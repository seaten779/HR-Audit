# Twilio Voice Integration Setup Instructions

## âœ… What's Working Now
Your Capital One API integration is working perfectly! The server successfully:
- Creates customer accounts
- Sets up credit card accounts with $5000 balance
- Processes sample transactions
- Responds with voice confirmation

## ðŸš€ To Fix the "Trial Account" Issue

The reason your calls are hanging up with "trial account" message is that Twilio doesn't know where to send the call. You need to configure the webhook URL.

### Step 1: Set up ngrok (Free Account Required)

1. **Sign up for ngrok**: Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
2. **Get your authtoken**: Visit https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
3. **Configure ngrok**:
   ```bash
   # In the twilio-cedar-integration directory
   .\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
   ```

### Step 2: Start ngrok tunnel
```bash
.\ngrok.exe http 5000
```

This will give you a URL like: `https://abc123-def456.ngrok-free.app`

### Step 3: Configure Twilio Webhook

1. **Go to Twilio Console**: https://console.twilio.com/
2. **Navigate to Phone Numbers**: Phone Numbers â†’ Manage â†’ Active numbers
3. **Click your number**: +16403568689
4. **Update Webhook URL**:
   - Set "Voice & Fax" webhook to: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/voice`
   - Method: HTTP POST
5. **Save Configuration**

### Step 4: Test Your Integration

Once configured, when you call +16403568689:

1. âœ… **Call connects** (no more "trial account" message)
2. âœ… **Greeting plays**: "Hello! I'm your Capital One API assistant..."
3. âœ… **Say any of these phrases** to trigger the API:
   - "run api"
   - "test api" 
   - "demo"
   - "capital one"
   - "banking"
   - "create account"

4. âœ… **API executes** and creates:
   - Customer account (John Doe in Austin, TX)
   - Credit card account ($5000 balance, 100 rewards)
   - Sample transaction ($25.99)

5. âœ… **Success message**: "Great! I successfully created a customer account, credit card account with $5000 balance, and processed a sample transaction of $25.99. The Capital One API integration is working perfectly!"

## ðŸ”§ Current Server Status

- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:5000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/health
- **Voice Webhook**: http://localhost:5000/voice
- **Speech Processing**: http://localhost:5000/gather
- **Capital One API**: âœ… Working perfectly

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens Now

When someone calls your Twilio number (+16403568689), they will:

1. Hear: "Hello! I'm your Capital One API assistant. I can help you test the banking API integration. What would you like me to do?"

2. Can say trigger words like "run api" or "demo"

3. The system will execute your Capital One API script that:
   - Creates a new customer (John Doe)
   - Creates a credit card account with $5000 balance
   - Makes a sample purchase of $25.99
   - Returns transaction analysis

4. Hear the success message confirming everything worked

## ðŸš¨ Alternative: Use a Different Tunneling Service

If you prefer not to sign up for ngrok, you can use:
- **Localtunnel**: `npm install -g localtunnel` then `lt --port 5000`
- **Serveo**: `ssh -R 80:localhost:5000 serveo.net`

Just update the Twilio webhook URL with whichever service you choose.

## âœ¨ Your Integration is Ready!

Your Capital One API integration is fully functional and ready to go. The only step left is configuring the webhook URL so Twilio knows where to send the calls instead of playing the "trial account" message.
